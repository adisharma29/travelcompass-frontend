  about:
    "Holi in Sangla is not a single afternoon of colours. It is a slow, multi-day community celebration known locally as Faguli / Phag, marking the transition from winter to spring. For several days, the valley moves together \u2014 through temples, village paths, forests, orchards, and open grounds \u2014 guided by ritual, music, shared meals, and collective movement. There is no fixed stage, no performance for visitors, and no separation between celebration and daily life. This experience invites you to walk alongside the community, observe closely, participate respectfully when invited, and witness Holi as it has been lived in Sangla for generations.",

    "Those comfortable with walking, uncertainty, and slow pacing",
