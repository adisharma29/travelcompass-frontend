      description:
        "We\u2019ll meet at the meeting point of the forest reserve where your e-bike and helmet await. After introductions, we\u2019ll share a short safety and riding orientation.

Here you may choose to sit next to a brook or on a sunny day, close your eyes & leave yourself unattended. This is our forest-bathing pause \u2014 time to breathe, listen, and let the calm settle in.",

You\u2019ll feel how the e-bike\u2019s quiet assist turns every pedal into effortless motion. As light softens through the trees, we find our way back fuller, calmer and somehow lighter.",

The Refuje team\u2019s 10 min session outside the range helped me get my confidence back \u2014 they have brand new mountain e-bikes that are super easy to ride. There were very few people inside and I could see a few cyclists too. The trail gives you a feel of riding through jungle and even the historic reservoir isn\u2019t too bad. Overall, loved it!",
