  about:
    "As the sun sinks behind the mighty Kinnaur Kailash range, the orchard comes alive with its own quiet rhythm. Our Sundowner in the Apple Orchard is an invitation to slow down \u2014 to watch the light change, to feel the air cool, and to discover how stillness can be the most beautiful sound of all. Set amidst fruit-laden apple trees and the snow peaks of Jorkanden and Raldang, this evening unfolds gently \u2014 local drinks, hand-brewed teas, and soft conversations around a crackling fire. No rush. No agenda. Just presence.",

Staff offered shawls when it got windy. Not a \u201cshow,\u201d more of a chill sit-down with views. Worth it if you want low-key.",
