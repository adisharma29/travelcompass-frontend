  about:
    "Late morning is when the orchard exhales. No dramatic golden peaks\u2014just soft daylight, birdsong, and the easy rhythm of local life. We begin with a gentle walk through the trees, learning how the orchard changes through the seasons. Then you settle into low seating, cushions, and hammocks for a chef-curated Himachali orchard brunch that leans on what\u2019s fresh and local. There\u2019s no rush here. Read, sketch, chat with our host, or simply do nothing at all. Kids can help the team with simple prep tasks (when available) or collect fallen leaves for a tiny nature journal. We keep it quiet, low-impact, and mindful\u2014no amplified music, no crowding, and definitely no litter.",

      text: "Easy booking and clear directions. Visited in October \u2014 shaded seating under the apple trees, with rugs, recliners and a few chairs. Brunch was local and tasty\u2014 buckwheat preparation with loads of ghee, rajma-chawal and a fresh chutney. Slow coffee and chai kept coming. Clean toilets and handwash. Bring a hat and sunscreen; it\u2019s warm until the breeze picks up.",

The food was homemade and super tasty, which we liked. Short orchard walk before eating. Timing (11\u201312:30) worked perfectly. We\u2019d return with friends for a private group.",

Coffee was good; also tried seabuckthorn juice. Brass plates and zero-litter approach stood out. Good nook for those who wish to travel slow and imbibe a place.",

But all of hassle was worth it \u2014 we started with a short orchard walk and then sat under a canopy. The view is to die for \u2014 snow clad mountains right in your face and Satluj down below. Food was simple and options limited but everything tasted good. Quiet setting, no crowding. Good for a slow afternoon.",
